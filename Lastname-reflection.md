What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

	I was struggling with trying to use it with GitHub, particularly how to push them then merge them on GitHub.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

	I now feel more comfortable with how to push my branch to GitHub, then merge the branches. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

	Unfortunately, I did not ask any questions.

What still confuses you about Git?

	I can't say I am necessarily confused, but I don't feel confident with git and GitHub. I always feel uncertain with what I do. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

	My first experience went well. I feel better about git and GitHub, our guide was helpful at the appropriate times, and I felt that I was on the same page with my pair.
