# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

     Before this GPS session I was struggling not with the workflow but more so the understanding of the way git was pushed up to Github. Now on the other hand I feel like I fully understand this.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

     For me I felt like it was pretty much everything. After I was done I felt very confident that I had overcome all the concerns or at least most of the concerns I had initially about git. I'm sure there is more to learn but for now it has all been answered. By the time we were done the only thing i had a question with was git fetch in which I now understand due to the help of my guide.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

     I had asked if (As a navigator) if I was going to fast. I personally felt like we were on the same page and worked great together. We had a great and similar way of communicating with each other. I also asked the guide about a pending question that I have had about the office hours and something that was irrelevent to this.

# What still confuses you about Git?

     To be honest after working with it for this long I wont say that I feel like a pro because that would just be rediculous but I will say that at this stage that I feel very comfortable about the workflow and how to use it with Github. Let's not forget that there is always more to learn.

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

     I absolutely loved it! To be completely honest I had thought that it would be way more like a test but even if it was I feel like my partner and I had done a great job. The best thing though is that I feel like my guide partner and I were a great fit from the very start. Nothing was uncomfortable and more so very comfortable and fun work environment. Shout out to the guide Aji and a fantastic partner Fernando!
